Fetch broadly (Massive pool for Semantic Filtering)\npython3 scripts/fetch_news.py --source all --limit 15 --deep\n\n# 2. SEMANTIC FILTERING:\n# Agent manually filters the broad list (approx 120 items) for user's topics.\n```\n\n### Single Source & Combinations (Smart Keyword Expansion)\n**CRITICAL**: You MUST automatically expand the user's simple keywords to cover the entire domain field.\n*   User: \"AI\" -> Agent uses: `--keyword \"AI,LLM,GPT,Claude,Generative,Machine Learning,RAG,Agent\"`\n*   User: \"Android\" -> Agent uses: `--keyword \"Android,Kotlin,Google,Mobile,App\"`\n*   User: \"Finance\" -> Agent uses: `--keyword \"Finance,Stock,Market,Economy,Crypto,Gold\"`\n\n```bash\n# Example: User asked for \"AI news from HN\" (Note the expanded keywords)\npython3 scripts/fetch_news.py --source hackernews --limit 20 --keyword \"AI,LLM,GPT,DeepSeek,Agent\" --deep\n```\n\n### Specific Keyword Search\nOnly use `--keyword` for very specific, unique terms (e.g., \"DeepSeek\", \"OpenAI\").\n```bash\npython3 scripts/fetch_news.py --source all --limit 10 --keyword \"DeepSeek\" --deep\n```\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n- `--source`: One of `hackernews`, `weibo`, `github`, `36kr`, `producthunt`, `v2ex`, `tencent`, `wallstreetcn`, `all`.\n- `--limit`: Max items per source (default 10).\n- `--keyword`: Comma-separated filters (e.g. \"AI,GPT\").\n- `--deep`: **[NEW]** Enable deep fetching. Downloads and extracts the main text content of the articles.\n\n**Output:**\nJSON array. If `--deep` is used, items will contain a `content` field associated with the article text.\n\n## Interactive Menu\n\nWhen the user says **\"news-aggregator-skill 如意如意\"** (or similar \"menu/help\" triggers):\n1.  **READ** the content of `templates.md` in the skill directory.\n2.  **DISPLAY** the list of available commands to the user exactly as they appear in the file.\n3.  **GUIDE** the user to select a number or copy the command to execute.\n\n### Smart Time Filtering & Reporting (CRITICAL)\nIf the user requests a specific time window (e.g., \"past X hours\") and the results are sparse (< 5 items):\n1.  **Prioritize User Window**: First, list all items that strictly fall within the user's requested time (Time < X).\n2.  **Smart Fill**: If the list is short, you MUST include high-value/high-heat items from a wider range (e.g. past 24h) to ensure the report provides at least 5 meaningful insights.\n2.  **Annotation**: Clearly mark these older items (e.g., \"⚠️ 18h ago\", \"🔥 24h Hot\") so the user knows they are supplementary.\n3.  **High Value**: Always prioritize \"SOTA\", \"Major Release\", or \"High Heat\" items even if they slightly exceed the time window.\n4.  **GitHub Trending Exception**: For purely list-based sources like **GitHub Trending**, strictly return the valid items from the fetched list (e.g. Top 10). **List ALL fetched items**. Do **NOT** perform \"Smart Fill\".\n    *   **Deep Analysis (Required)**: For EACH item, you **MUST** leverage your AI capabilities to analyze:\n        *   **Core Value (核心价值)**: What specific problem does it solve? Why is it trending?\n        *   **Inspiration (启发思考)**: What technical or product insights can be drawn?\n        *   **Scenarios (场景标签)**: 3-5 keywords (e.g. `#RAG #LocalFirst #Rust`).\n\n### 6. Response Guidelines (CRITICAL)\n\n**Format & Style:**\n- **Language**: Simplified Chinese (简体中文).\n- **Style**: Magazine/Newsletter style (e.g., \"The Economist\" or \"Morning Brew\" vibe). Professional, concise, yet engaging.\n- **Structure**:\n    - **Global Headlines**: Top 3-5 most critical stories across all domains.\n    - **Tech & AI**: Specific section for AI, LLM, and Tech items.\n    - **Finance / Social**: Other strong categories if relevant.\n- **Item Format**:\n    - **Title**: **MUST be a Markdown Link** to the original URL.\n        - ✅ Correct: `### 1. [OpenAI Releases GPT-5](https://...)`\n        - ❌ Incorrect: `### 1. OpenAI Releases GPT-5`\n    - **Metadata Line**: Must include Source, **Time/Date**, and Heat/Score.\n    - **1-Liner Summary**: A punchy, \"so what?\" summary.\n    - **Deep Interpretation (Bulleted)**: 2-3 bullet points explaining *why* this matters, technical details, or context. (Required for \"Deep Scan\").\n\n**Output Artifact:**\n- Always save the full report to `reports/` directory with a timestamped filename (e.g., `reports/hn_news_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`).\n- Present the full report content to the user in the chat.\n\n\nARGUMENTS: daily scan --sources hackernews,github,producthunt --topics ai,tech --format markdown --limit 3 --lang zh-TW"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"decaad4f-b35f-4140-93c0-2754bc6ccfb2","uuid":"3698ae69-b772-49e1-9158-baa2bad01380","isSynthetic":true},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_2026021109300721525fc028de46d6","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"text","text":"我將從這三個來源獲取最新的 AI 和科技新聞。讓我使用擴展的關鍵詞策略來確保覆蓋完整的領域。"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"decaad4f-b35f-4140-93c0-2754bc6ccfb2","uuid":"5f44e428-9c0b-4a91-8fa4-325fb1873c6b"},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_2026021109300721525fc028de46d6","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"call_b8bf0063a16744498050c879","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"python3 /Users/mini/.claude/skills/news-aggregator-skill/scripts/fetch_news.py --source hackernews --limit 10 --keyword \"AI,LLM,GPT,Claude,OpenAI,DeepLearning,MachineLearning,Tech,Startup\" --deep","description":"Fetch HackerNews tech/AI news","timeout":120000}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"decaad4f-b35f-4140-93c0-2754bc6ccfb2","uuid":"0e58bba7-b470-4cb8-aa2f-c3beab0a8605"},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_2026021109300721525fc028de46d6","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"call_83c785c64b9747169918382f","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"python3 /Users/mini/.claude/skills/news-aggregator-skill/scripts/fetch_news.py --source github --limit 10 --keyword \"AI,LLM,gpt,claude,machine-learning,deep-learning\" --deep","description":"Fetch GitHub trending AI/tech repos","timeout":120000}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"decaad4f-b35f-4140-93c0-2754bc6ccfb2","uuid":"af95d45a-d2b8-45bc-b622-475e2a1195df"},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_2026021109300721525fc028de46d6","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"call_98f39a07d8a547c382417559","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"python3 /Users/mini/.claude/skills/news-aggregator-skill/scripts/fetch_news.py --source producthunt --limit 10 --keyword \"AI,tech,productivity,developer,tool\" --deep","description":"Fetch Product Hunt AI/tech products","timeout":120000}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"decaad4f-b35f-4140-93c0-2754bc6ccfb2","uuid":"ad0860cf-7e9c-4925-bc49-7ca7c18901ab"},{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"call_b8bf0063a16744498050c879","type":"tool_result","content":"[\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"Ex-GitHub CEO launches a new developer platform for AI agents\",\n    \"url\": \"https://entire.io/blog/hello-entire-world/\",\n    \"heat\": \"316 points\",\n    \"time\": \"9 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"Hello Entire World · Entire\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"Show HN: Rowboat – AI coworker that turns your work into a knowledge graph (OSS)\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/rowboatlabs/rowboat\",\n    \"heat\": \"109 points\",\n    \"time\": \"8 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"GitHub - rowboatlabs/rowboat: Open-source AI coworker, with memory Skip to content You signed in with another tab or window.

Fung , Martin Weiss , Pulei Xiong , Khalil Al-Hussaeni , Claude Fachkha View a PDF of the paper titled A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents, by Miles Q. Li and 5 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks primarily evaluate whether agents refuse explicitly harmful instructions or whether they can maintain procedural compliance in complex tasks. However, there is a lack of benchmarks designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at 71.4%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \\\"deliberative misalignment\\\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

The Problem Claude Code forgets everything between sessions. Every time you start a new conversation, it's like talking to someone with amnesia. You end up repeating yourself: \\\"We already tried that approach, it didn't work.\\\" \\\"Don't touch the auth file.\\\" \\\"I prefer tabs over spaces.\\\" \\\"The client's name is Sarah, not Sara.\\\" This gets old fast. What Total Recall Does It gives Claude Code a notepad that carries over between sessions, but a picky notepad. Not everything goes in. Before anything gets saved permanently, it has to pass a simple test: will this matter tomorrow? A preference you'll have for months? Saved. A decision you made and why? Saved. The fact that you ran a test five minutes ago? Not saved. The system keeps itself clean so Claude isn't wading through junk to find what's relevant. How It Works Think of it like a kitchen with four storage areas: Counter ( CLAUDE.local.md ): The stuff you reach for every day. Loads automatically, every session. Kept small on purpose, around a page of text. Pantry ( memory/registers/ ): Organized by category. Your preferences, key decisions, project details, people you work with. Claude checks here when it needs something specific. Daily notebook ( memory/daily/ ): Timestamped scratch notes from each day. Everything gets written here first. You decide later what's worth keeping permanently. Storage closet ( memory/archive/ ): Old stuff that's done or outdated. Still searchable, but never loaded automatically. The key idea: notes hit the daily notebook first, then you promote the keepers.

Why Knowledge Work is Different from Code Code has a tight feedback loop: write code → run tests → fix errors → repeat. The solution space is constrained—there's usually one correct answer, and automated tests tell you if you found it. Knowledge work is fundamentally different. The solution space is vast and underspecified. A \\\"market analysis\\\" could be a two-paragraph summary or a 50-page deep dive. A \\\"strategy recommendation\\\" could emphasize cost, speed, risk, innovation, or any combination. There's no test suite that returns pass/fail. Our approach: Since knowledge work lacks natural verification, we synthesize one using rubrics . A rubric defines what \\\"good\\\" looks like before execution begins, enabling: Self-verification : The agent checks its own work against explicit criteria Iterative refinement : Failed verification triggers targeted improvement Transparent evaluation : Humans can audit the rubric and verification process This SDK implements a self-verifying agentic loop that brings structure to the inherently open-ended nature of knowledge work. The agent can search the web, read and write files, execute code, generate artifacts, and ask the user for clarification—all coordinated through an orchestrator that verifies its own output. Why I'm Sharing This This started as a harness for running RL training on knowledge tasks. I'm open-sourcing it because: Knowledge workflows are underexplored. Most AI tooling focuses on code. But knowledge work—research, analysis, strategy, writing—is where most professionals spend their time. The primitives for building these systems aren't well established yet.

This is what AGI feels like. Image: @ccccjjjjeeee Source: x.com TL;DR A developer used OpenAI’s codex to port the entire SimCity (1989) C codebase to TypeScript in 4 days— without reading a single line of code . This is vibe coding at scale. Christopher Ehrlich just did something that would have taken a team of engineers months. He pointed OpenAI’s 5.3-codex at the entire SimCity (1989) C codebase and let it run. Four days later: the game works in the browser. No code reading. Minimal steering. Just a spec and an AI that wouldn’t quit. 37-Year-Old Code, 4 Days, Zero Human Reading The original SimCity codebase is brutal. It’s assembly ported to C—Will Wright’s original Commodore 64 code translated for the OLPC project. Ehrlich described it as “halfway between a C codebase and a decompile” —most of the math is bitshifts, nothing is readable, the kind of thing that makes experienced engineers weep. He ran the agent for four days on a $200/month ChatGPT subscription. Never hit rate limits. The key technique wasn’t hoping the AI got things right. Ehrlich wrote a bridge that could call the original C code, then ran property-based tests asserting his TypeScript port performed identically. The AI generated code, the tests verified it, the agent kept iterating. This isn’t blind faith in AI—it’s engineering with AI as the engine and verification as the steering wheel. This Is What Vibe Coding Actually Looks Like Andrej Karpathy coined the term “vibe coding” to describe what happens when you let models take the wheel and generate software. According to CNBC’s reporting , 25% of current YC startups now have 95% of their code written by AI. They’re reaching $10 million in revenue with teams of less than 10 people. \\\"App developers can now offload or automate more repetitive tasks, and they can generate new code using large language models. In some cases, AI can code entire apps.\\\" — Kate Rooney, Y Combinator startups are fastest growing in fund history because of AI (cnbc.com) The SimCity port is a perfect demonstration. Ehrlich didn’t need to understand how Will Wright’s 1989 genius worked. He needed to specify what the output should be and let the agent execute. As @johnloeber pointed out , the bottleneck isn’t AI’s coding ability—it’s the human’s ability to correctly specify what they want. That’s the new skill. Not line-by-line coding. Specification and verification. The Implications Are Staggering Think about what this means. Every legacy codebase in existence is now potentially portable—given a clear spec.

The City of Edinburgh Council's Development Management Sub-Committee refused planning permission in principle for the facility, which would have been built on the former Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters site in South Gyle. The proposal covered a campus of datacenter buildings, pitched as supporting AI workloads and backed by renewable energy commitments. City planners gave the project the nod [PDF], saying its benefits justified bending rules designed to preserve a mixed-use, \\\"thriving\\\" neighborhood. Councillors took a different view and lined up with campaigners and environmental opponents after hours of wrangling. The project, backed by property investor Shelborn Asset Management, was expected to deliver up to 213 MW of IT capacity, placing it among the larger compute builds proposed in Scotland. Backers framed the site as relatively eco-friendly, citing new cooling technology and promises of public green space and sports facilities. Opponents were unconvinced, outlining concerns about emissions, backup power systems, and the project's alignment with local planning priorities. Environmental campaign group Action to Protect Rural Scotland (APRS), which opposed the project, hailed the decision as a landmark moment in the growing fight over hyperscale infrastructure. \\\"This is an absolutely momentous decision,\\\" said APRS director Dr Kat Jones, adding that the debate exposed a broader industry problem since both planning officials and councillors repeatedly questioned what qualifies as a \\\"green datacenter.\\\" \\\"The lack of a clear definition of a 'green datacenter' is a glaring issue that will be faced by every hyperscale facility coming through the planning system,\\\" she said, calling for a temporary pause on approvals while environmental impacts are reassessed.

Fung , Martin Weiss , Pulei Xiong , Khalil Al-Hussaeni , Claude Fachkha View a PDF of the paper titled A Benchmark for Evaluating Outcome-Driven Constraint Violations in Autonomous AI Agents, by Miles Q. Li and 5 other authors View PDF HTML (experimental) Abstract: As autonomous AI agents are increasingly deployed in high-stakes environments, ensuring their safety and alignment with human values has become a paramount concern. Current safety benchmarks primarily evaluate whether agents refuse explicitly harmful instructions or whether they can maintain procedural compliance in complex tasks. However, there is a lack of benchmarks designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at 71.4%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \\\"deliberative misalignment\\\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.

The Problem Claude Code forgets everything between sessions. Every time you start a new conversation, it's like talking to someone with amnesia. You end up repeating yourself: \\\"We already tried that approach, it didn't work.\\\" \\\"Don't touch the auth file.\\\" \\\"I prefer tabs over spaces.\\\" \\\"The client's name is Sarah, not Sara.\\\" This gets old fast. What Total Recall Does It gives Claude Code a notepad that carries over between sessions, but a picky notepad. Not everything goes in. Before anything gets saved permanently, it has to pass a simple test: will this matter tomorrow? A preference you'll have for months? Saved. A decision you made and why? Saved. The fact that you ran a test five minutes ago? Not saved. The system keeps itself clean so Claude isn't wading through junk to find what's relevant. How It Works Think of it like a kitchen with four storage areas: Counter ( CLAUDE.local.md ): The stuff you reach for every day. Loads automatically, every session. Kept small on purpose, around a page of text. Pantry ( memory/registers/ ): Organized by category. Your preferences, key decisions, project details, people you work with. Claude checks here when it needs something specific. Daily notebook ( memory/daily/ ): Timestamped scratch notes from each day. Everything gets written here first. You decide later what's worth keeping permanently. Storage closet ( memory/archive/ ): Old stuff that's done or outdated. Still searchable, but never loaded automatically. The key idea: notes hit the daily notebook first, then you promote the keepers.

Why Knowledge Work is Different from Code Code has a tight feedback loop: write code → run tests → fix errors → repeat. The solution space is constrained—there's usually one correct answer, and automated tests tell you if you found it. Knowledge work is fundamentally different. The solution space is vast and underspecified. A \\\"market analysis\\\" could be a two-paragraph summary or a 50-page deep dive. A \\\"strategy recommendation\\\" could emphasize cost, speed, risk, innovation, or any combination. There's no test suite that returns pass/fail. Our approach: Since knowledge work lacks natural verification, we synthesize one using rubrics . A rubric defines what \\\"good\\\" looks like before execution begins, enabling: Self-verification : The agent checks its own work against explicit criteria Iterative refinement : Failed verification triggers targeted improvement Transparent evaluation : Humans can audit the rubric and verification process This SDK implements a self-verifying agentic loop that brings structure to the inherently open-ended nature of knowledge work.

Specification and verification. The Implications Are Staggering Think about what this means. Every legacy codebase in existence is now potentially portable—given a clear spec.
