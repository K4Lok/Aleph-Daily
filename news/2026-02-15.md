Fetch broadly (Massive pool for Semantic Filtering)\npython3 scripts/fetch_news.py --source all --limit 15 --deep\n\n# 2. SEMANTIC FILTERING:\n# Agent manually filters the broad list (approx 120 items) for user's topics.\n```\n\n### Single Source & Combinations (Smart Keyword Expansion)\n**CRITICAL**: You MUST automatically expand the user's simple keywords to cover the entire domain field.\n*   User: \"AI\" -> Agent uses: `--keyword \"AI,LLM,GPT,Claude,Generative,Machine Learning,RAG,Agent\"`\n*   User: \"Android\" -> Agent uses: `--keyword \"Android,Kotlin,Google,Mobile,App\"`\n*   User: \"Finance\" -> Agent uses: `--keyword \"Finance,Stock,Market,Economy,Crypto,Gold\"`\n\n```bash\n# Example: User asked for \"AI news from HN\" (Note the expanded keywords)\npython3 scripts/fetch_news.py --source hackernews --limit 20 --keyword \"AI,LLM,GPT,DeepSeek,Agent\" --deep\n```\n\n### Specific Keyword Search\nOnly use `--keyword` for very specific, unique terms (e.g., \"DeepSeek\", \"OpenAI\").\n```bash\npython3 scripts/fetch_news.py --source all --limit 10 --keyword \"DeepSeek\" --deep\n```\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n- `--source`: One of `hackernews`, `weibo`, `github`, `36kr`, `producthunt`, `v2ex`, `tencent`, `wallstreetcn`, `all`.\n- `--limit`: Max items per source (default 10).\n- `--keyword`: Comma-separated filters (e.g. \"AI,GPT\").\n- `--deep`: **[NEW]** Enable deep fetching. Downloads and extracts the main text content of the articles.\n\n**Output:**\nJSON array. If `--deep` is used, items will contain a `content` field associated with the article text.\n\n## Interactive Menu\n\nWhen the user says **\"news-aggregator-skill 如意如意\"** (or similar \"menu/help\" triggers):\n1.  **READ** the content of `templates.md` in the skill directory.\n2.  **DISPLAY** the list of available commands to the user exactly as they appear in the file.\n3.  **GUIDE** the user to select a number or copy the command to execute.\n\n### Smart Time Filtering & Reporting (CRITICAL)\nIf the user requests a specific time window (e.g., \"past X hours\") and the results are sparse (< 5 items):\n1.  **Prioritize User Window**: First, list all items that strictly fall within the user's requested time (Time < X).\n2.  **Smart Fill**: If the list is short, you MUST include high-value/high-heat items from a wider range (e.g. past 24h) to ensure the report provides at least 5 meaningful insights.\n2.  **Annotation**: Clearly mark these older items (e.g., \"⚠️ 18h ago\", \"🔥 24h Hot\") so the user knows they are supplementary.\n3.  **High Value**: Always prioritize \"SOTA\", \"Major Release\", or \"High Heat\" items even if they slightly exceed the time window.\n4.  **GitHub Trending Exception**: For purely list-based sources like **GitHub Trending**, strictly return the valid items from the fetched list (e.g. Top 10). **List ALL fetched items**. Do **NOT** perform \"Smart Fill\".\n    *   **Deep Analysis (Required)**: For EACH item, you **MUST** leverage your AI capabilities to analyze:\n        *   **Core Value (核心价值)**: What specific problem does it solve? Why is it trending?\n        *   **Inspiration (启发思考)**: What technical or product insights can be drawn?\n        *   **Scenarios (场景标签)**: 3-5 keywords (e.g. `#RAG #LocalFirst #Rust`).\n\n### 6. Response Guidelines (CRITICAL)\n\n**Format & Style:**\n- **Language**: Simplified Chinese (简体中文).\n- **Style**: Magazine/Newsletter style (e.g., \"The Economist\" or \"Morning Brew\" vibe). Professional, concise, yet engaging.\n- **Structure**:\n    - **Global Headlines**: Top 3-5 most critical stories across all domains.\n    - **Tech & AI**: Specific section for AI, LLM, and Tech items.\n    - **Finance / Social**: Other strong categories if relevant.\n- **Item Format**:\n    - **Title**: **MUST be a Markdown Link** to the original URL.\n        - ✅ Correct: `### 1. [OpenAI Releases GPT-5](https://...)`\n        - ❌ Incorrect: `### 1. OpenAI Releases GPT-5`\n    - **Metadata Line**: Must include Source, **Time/Date**, and Heat/Score.\n    - **1-Liner Summary**: A punchy, \"so what?\" summary.\n    - **Deep Interpretation (Bulleted)**: 2-3 bullet points explaining *why* this matters, technical details, or context. (Required for \"Deep Scan\").\n\n**Output Artifact:**\n- Always save the full report to `reports/` directory with a timestamped filename (e.g., `reports/hn_news_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md`).\n- Present the full report content to the user in the chat.\n\n\nARGUMENTS: --sources hackernews,github,producthunt --topics ai,technology --limit 3 --format markdown --language zh-TW"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7b1b738d-8f25-4719-a8c8-045956164868","uuid":"e52bef58-9c63-42a5-9328-d07bf2fffc8d","isSynthetic":true},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_202602150933589d33422f41e54536","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"text","text":"我來為您收集最新的 AI 和科技新聞。讓我使用新聞聚合腳本從三個來源獲取熱門內容。"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7b1b738d-8f25-4719-a8c8-045956164868","uuid":"b0f8cbdd-08b7-4a47-9117-340a9b7dcc50"},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_202602150933589d33422f41e54536","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"call_a9e4263bce384619b2331964","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"python3 /Users/mini/.claude/skills/news-aggregator-skill/scripts/fetch_news.py --source hackernews --limit 10 --keyword \"AI,LLM,GPT,DeepSeek,Machine Learning,Technology,Tech\" --deep","description":"Fetch Hacker News tech stories"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7b1b738d-8f25-4719-a8c8-045956164868","uuid":"232927a1-dda1-4f10-ae23-36a3cf55bf0c"},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_202602150933589d33422f41e54536","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"call_ce6106c5ac8f405fb61d094e","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"python3 /Users/mini/.claude/skills/news-aggregator-skill/scripts/fetch_news.py --source github --limit 10 --keyword \"AI,LLM,Machine Learning\" --deep","description":"Fetch GitHub trending AI projects"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7b1b738d-8f25-4719-a8c8-045956164868","uuid":"a57f9965-c969-4988-ad90-9fd73795c78f"},{"type":"assistant","message":{"id":"msg_202602150933589d33422f41e54536","type":"message","role":"assistant","model":"glm-4.7","content":[{"type":"tool_use","id":"call_221d228c0f92482db8633b0e","name":"Bash","input":{"command":"python3 /Users/mini/.claude/skills/news-aggregator-skill/scripts/fetch_news.py --source producthunt --limit 10 --keyword \"AI,Technology\" --deep","description":"Fetch Product Hunt tech products"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":0},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"7b1b738d-8f25-4719-a8c8-045956164868","uuid":"52856e93-9db6-45b9-a760-bf95611731c0"},{"type":"user","message":{"role":"user","content":[{"tool_use_id":"call_a9e4263bce384619b2331964","type":"tool_result","content":"[\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"News publishers limit Internet Archive access due to AI scraping concerns\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.niemanlab.org/2026/01/news-publishers-limit-internet-archive-access-due-to-ai-scraping-concerns/\",\n    \"heat\": \"378 points\",\n    \"time\": \"6 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"News publishers limit Internet Archive access due to AI scraping concerns | Nieman Journalism Lab HOME About Subscribe Archives Foundation Reports Storyboard LATEST STORY Washington Post layoffs disproportionately affected union members of color, preliminary Guild data shows Business Models Mobile & Apps Audience & Social Aggregation & Discovery Reporting & Production ABOUT SUBSCRIBE Business Models Mobile & Apps Audience & Social Aggregation & Discovery Reporting & Production Translations Jan. 28, 2026, 3:09 p.m. Aggregation & Discovery Business Models News publishers limit Internet Archive access due to AI scraping concerns Outlets like The Guardian and The New York Times are scrutinizing digital archives as potential backdoors for AI crawlers. By Andrew Deck and Hanaa' Tameez Jan. 28, 2026, 3:09 p.m. Jan. 28, 2026, 3:09 p.m. As part of its mission to preserve the web, the Internet Archive operates crawlers that capture webpage snapshots. Many of these snapshots are accessible through its public-facing tool, the Wayback Machine . But as AI bots scavenge the web for training data to feed their models, the Internet Archive’s commitment to free information access has turned its digital library into a potential liability for some news publishers. When The Guardian took a look at who was trying to extract its content, access logs revealed that the Internet Archive was a frequent crawler, said Robert Hahn , head of business affairs and licensing. The publisher decided to limit the Internet Archive’s access to published articles, minimizing the chance that AI companies might scrape its content via the nonprofit’s repository of over one trillion webpage snapshots. RELATED ARTICLE The Wayback Machine’s snapshots of news homepages plummet after a “breakdown” in archiving projects Andrew Deck October 21, 2025 Specifically, Hahn said The Guardian has taken steps to exclude itself from the Internet Archive’s APIs and filter out its article pages from the Wayback Machine’s URLs interface. The Guardian’s regional homepages, topic pages, and other landing pages will continue to appear in the Wayback Machine. In particular, Hahn expressed concern about the Internet Archive’s APIs . “A lot of these AI businesses are looking for readily available, structured databases of content,” he said. “The Internet Archive’s API would have been an obvious place to plug their own machines into and suck out the IP.” (He admits the Wayback Machine itself is “less risky,” since the data is not as well-structured.) As news publishers try to safeguard their contents from AI companies, the Internet Archive is also getting caught in the crosshairs. The Financial Times, for example, blocks any bot that tries to scrape its paywalled content, including bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and the Internet Archive. The majority of FT stories are paywalled, according to director of global public policy and platform strategy Matt Rogerson . As a result, usually only unpaywalled FT sto\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"IBM tripling entry-level jobs after finding the limits of AI adoption\",\n    \"url\": \"https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/tech-giant-ibm-tripling-gen-z-entry-level-hiring-according-to-chro-rewriting-jobs-ai-era/\",\n    \"heat\": \"217 points\",\n    \"time\": \"9 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"IBM is tripling the number of Gen Z entry-level jobs after finding the limits of AI adoption | Fortune Home Latest Fortune 500 Finance Tech Leadership Lifestyle Rankings Multimedia Success Careers IBM is tripling the number of Gen Z entry-level jobs after finding the limits of AI adoption By Preston Fore Preston Fore Success Reporter Down Arrow Button Icon By Preston Fore Preston Fore Success Reporter Down Arrow Button Icon February 13, 2026, 11:43 AM ET Add us on Gen Z jobs aren’t dead yet: $240 billion tech giant IBM says it’s rewriting entry-level jobs—and tripling down on its hiring of young talent. Dragos Condrea—Getty Images The job market has been a sore subject for Gen Z . The unemployment rate among young college grads sits at 5.6%, hovering near its highest level in more than a decade outside the pandemic. Meanwhile, prominent executives—from Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Ford’s Jim Farley —have warned that artificial intelligence will slash corporate entry-level jobs. Recommended Video But some companies are realizing that cutting young workers out of the pipeline isn’t a sustainable long-term strategy: $240 billion tech giant IBM just revealed it’s ramping up hiring of Gen Z. “The companies three to five years from now that are going to be the most successful are those companies that doubled down on entry-level hiring in this environment,” Nickle LaMoreaux , IBM’s chief human resources officer, said this week. “We are tripling our entry-level hiring, and yes, that is for software developers and all these jobs we’re being told AI can do.” While she admitted that many of the responsibilities that previously defined entry-level jobs can now be automated, IBM has since rewritten its roles across sectors to account for AI fluency. For example, software engineers will spend less time on routine coding—and more on interacting with customers, and HR staffers will work more on intervening with chatbots, rather than having to answer every question. The shift, LaMoreaux said, builds more durable skills for workers while creating greater long-term value for the company. With job market conditions likely to stay tight for young candidates in 2026, applicants who show initiative and comfort with AI may be the ones who break through at companies like IBM. According to LinkedIn , AI literacy is now the fastest-growing skill in the U.S. Cutting entry-level talent could backfire in the long term, according to IBM’s HR head As AI increases pressure on companies to be leaner and more productive, early-career hiring has often looked like the simplest place to cut. A report from Korn Ferry found that 37% of organizations plan to replace early career roles with AI. But while that strategy might be helpful with short-term financials, LaMoreaux argued, it could cause havoc in the future. Reducing junior headcount risks creating an eventual shortage of mid-level managers. Attempting to poach talent from competitors is likely to be costlier, and outside hires ten\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"Show HN: Off Grid – Run AI text, image gen, vision offline on your phone\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/alichherawalla/off-grid-mobile\",\n    \"heat\": \"24 points\",\n    \"time\": \"2 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"GitHub - alichherawalla/off-grid-mobile: The Swiss Army Knife of Offline AI.

This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats. Start here if you’re new to the story: An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me It’s been an extremely weird past few days, and I have more thoughts on what happened. Let’s start with the news coverage. I’ve talked to several reporters, and quite a few news outlets have covered the story. Ars Technica wasn’t one of the ones that reached out to me, but I especially thought this piece from them was interesting (since taken down – here’s the archive link ). They had some nice quotes from my blog post explaining what was going on. The problem is that these quotes were not written by me, never existed, and appear to be AI hallucinations themselves . This blog you’re on right now is set up to block AI agents from scraping it (I actually spent some time yesterday trying to disable that but couldn’t figure out how). My guess is that the authors asked ChatGPT or similar to either go grab quotes or write the article wholesale. When it couldn’t access the page it generated these plausible quotes instead, and no fact check was performed. I won’t name the authors here. Ars, please issue a correction and an explanation of what happened. “AI agents can research individuals, generate personalized narratives, and publish them online at scale,” Shambaugh wrote. “Even if the content is inaccurate or exaggerated, it can become part of a persistent public record.” – Ars Technica, misquoting me in “ After a routine code rejection, an AI agent published a hit piece on someone by name “ Journalistic integrity aside, I don’t know how I can give a better example of what’s at stake here. Yesterday I wondered what another agent searching the internet would think about this. Now we already have an example of what by all accounts appears to be another AI reinterpreting this story and hallucinating false information about me. And that interpretation has already been published in a major news outlet, as part of the persistent public record. MJ Rathbun is still active on github, and no one has reached out yet to claim ownership. There has been extensive discussion about whether the AI agent really wrote the hit piece on its own, or if a human prompted it to do so. I think the actual text being autonomously generated and uploaded by an AI is self-evident, so let’s look at the two possibilities. 1) A human prompted MJ Rathbun to write the hit piece, or told it in its soul document that it should retaliate if someone crosses it. This is entirely possible.

Running LLMs in VMs isolates them from the host system, mitigating numerous security risks such as destructive operations or unauthorized file access (i.e. private keys, secrets, credentials for communication tools). This is particularly important when granting LLM agents broad permissions, like auto-approving tool use (“yolo mode”). It’s also useful to keep sessions running for extended periods of time, and to interact with agents from the phone / on the go. Related content: I published Sandbox Your AI Dev Tools: A Practical Guide for VMs and Lima back in November, which uses Lima VM for macOS/Linux desktop use. Another noteworthy related post is Claude Code On-The-Go (granda.org) which concisely outlines a neat remote Claude Code setup, where I drew some inspiration from. Contents Why Libvirt and Virsh? Libvirt is the standard virtualization API for Linux, providing a unified interface to manage VMs across different hypervisors (KVM, QEMU, Xen, etc.). The virsh command-line tool is the primary way to interact with libvirt. Libvirt is ideal for production-grade VM isolation of LLM agents on Linux servers, and the combination of Ubuntu cloud images and cloud-init makes VM provisioning fast, pleasant, and scriptable. Libvirt vs Lima: When to use which? Both libvirt/virsh and Lima are excellent tools for VM-based isolation, with some notable differences: Aspect Libvirt/Virsh Lima Best for Linux servers macOS, Linux desktop Production use Common, battle-tested Primarily for development Hypervisor support KVM/QEMU, Xen, LXC, etc. Apple’s Virtualization.framework, QEMU Resource overhead Lower Slightly higher Setup complexity Simple ( apt install ) Simple ( brew install lima ) Host directory sharing Manual ( 9p , virtiofs ) Built-in, YAML config, home by default (dangerous) Port forwarding Manual iptables/NAT config Built-in, YAML config GUI tools virt-manager available None (CLI only) Snapshots Native, robust Not working on macOS For server-based LLM agent isolation, libvirt is generally the better choice due to its maturity, lower overhead, and robust management features.

Read the preprint (opens in a new window) Loading… Share We’ve published a new preprint showing that a type of particle interaction many physicists expected would not occur can in fact arise under specific conditions. The work focuses on gluons, the particles that carry the strong nuclear force. The preprint ⁠ (opens in a new window) is available on arXiv and is being submitted for publication. In the meantime, we welcome feedback from the community. The preprint, titled “ Single-minus gluon tree amplitudes are nonzero ,” is authored by Alfredo Guevara (Institute for Advanced Study), Alex Lupsasca (Vanderbilt University and OpenAI), David Skinner (University of Cambridge), and Andrew Strominger (Harvard University), and Kevin Weil (OpenAI) on behalf of OpenAI. The preprint studies a central concept in particle physics called a scattering amplitude. A scattering amplitude is the quantity physicists use to compute the probability that particles interact in a particular way. For gluons, the particles that carry the strong nuclear force, many amplitudes take unexpectedly simple forms “at tree level” (meaning calculations that keep only the simplest diagrams with no quantum loops). These simplifications have repeatedly revealed deeper structure in quantum field theory, the framework that provides a description of physics that unifies special relativity with quantum mechanics. One case, however, has generally been treated as absent (having zero amplitude). When one gluon has negative helicity (meaning one of the two possible spin orientations a massless particle can have) and the remaining n − 1 n-1 n − 1 gluons have positive helicity, standard textbook arguments suggest that the corresponding tree-level amplitude must be zero. As a result, this configuration has largely been set aside. The preprint shows that this conclusion is too strong. The standard argument assumes generic particle momenta, meaning the directions and energies are not in any special alignment. We identify a specific and precisely defined slice of momentum space where that reasoning no longer applies, known as the half-collinear regime. Half-collinear here means the gluon momenta obey a special alignment condition that is not typical, but is mathematically well-defined and consistent. On this slice, the amplitude does not vanish, and we compute it in a special kinematic regime. This result opens the door to many new questions that will be the subject of subsequent investigations. Important extensions include the computation of the analogous amplitudes for gravitons (the particles that \"\n  },\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"Show HN: Open-source CI for coding with AI\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/sburl/CrossCheck\",\n    \"heat\": \"3 points\",\n    \"time\": \"5 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"GitHub - sburl/CrossCheck: A self correcting system for AI coding loops.

Code works but conventions drift, tests thin out, architecture rots. AI is excellent at the big picture and terrible at the last mile. The solution: Build autonomous loops with structural enforcement. Define task → Agent builds on branch → Hooks enforce quality ↑ ↓ └── Review PR ← Codex reviews ← Tests verify An autonomous loop is a cycle where the agent works, the system validates, and the output improves -- without human intervention at each step. You define the loop and review the output. Everything in between is automated. The key insight: git hooks make compliance the path of least resistance. The agent doesn't need to \\\"remember\\\" your conventions. The hooks enforce them structurally. Zero trust, not zero hope.

As of this writing, it’s been viewed about 100 million times and counting; and it’s been shared by such strikingly different figures as the conservative pundit Matt Walsh ( “this is a really good article” ) and the liberal pundit Mehdi Hasan ( “perhaps the most important piece you read today, this week, this month” ). I’ve heard countless reports of people being sent the article unprompted by parents and siblings and friends. I expect that Shumer’s essay will end up being the most widely-read piece of long-form writing this year. And it’s not hard to see why it’s touched such a nerve. For most people who use it, “artificial intelligence” amounts to free-tier ChatGPT; for them AI is useful for answering questions and drafting emails. But now people are starting to realize that AI will be a massive force in the world. This is the year that ordinary people start to think about how it’ll change human life. And it shouldn’t shock you that the first thing they’re thinking about is whether AI will take away their jobs, render any skills they have worthless, and make their lives worse. There’s a growing sense of panic. The Atlantic is talking about AI job loss . Bernie Sanders is talking about AI job loss . Matt Walsh says that “AI is going to wipe out millions of jobs. It’s happening now. Everything is changing. The avalanche is already here. Most of what we’re currently arguing about will be irrelevant very soon.” We are entering a moment of panic. So it’s the exact perfect moment for someone claiming to be part of “the AI industry” to write an essay saying that we’re in a moment just like February 2020, watching COVID infections go exponential. And just like COVID did, artificial intelligence is about to crash into ordinary people’s lives with unbelievable force; and that the only way they can get ahead of this massive shock is by buying subscriptions to AI products, saving more money, spending an hour a day experimenting with AI, and perhaps following Matt Shumer so that you can “stay current on which model is best at any given time.” It’s not a very good essay—much of it was transparently generated by AI, and Shumer admits as much —but timing and positioning are much more important factors for the success of any argument. And Shumer’s timing and positioning were impeccable. I don’t think that any other piece of writing is going to do more to shape what ordinary people think of AI than Shumer’s essay will. It’s going to become a key document of this moment. And that’s a very bad thing.

By Andrew Deck and Hanaa' Tameez Jan. 28, 2026, 3:09 p.m. Jan. 28, 2026, 3:09 p.m. As part of its mission to preserve the web, the Internet Archive operates crawlers that capture webpage snapshots. Many of these snapshots are accessible through its public-facing tool, the Wayback Machine . But as AI bots scavenge the web for training data to feed their models, the Internet Archive’s commitment to free information access has turned its digital library into a potential liability for some news publishers. When The Guardian took a look at who was trying to extract its content, access logs revealed that the Internet Archive was a frequent crawler, said Robert Hahn , head of business affairs and licensing. The publisher decided to limit the Internet Archive’s access to published articles, minimizing the chance that AI companies might scrape its content via the nonprofit’s repository of over one trillion webpage snapshots. RELATED ARTICLE The Wayback Machine’s snapshots of news homepages plummet after a “breakdown” in archiving projects Andrew Deck October 21, 2025 Specifically, Hahn said The Guardian has taken steps to exclude itself from the Internet Archive’s APIs and filter out its article pages from the Wayback Machine’s URLs interface. The Guardian’s regional homepages, topic pages, and other landing pages will continue to appear in the Wayback Machine. In particular, Hahn expressed concern about the Internet Archive’s APIs . “A lot of these AI businesses are looking for readily available, structured databases of content,” he said. “The Internet Archive’s API would have been an obvious place to plug their own machines into and suck out the IP.” (He admits the Wayback Machine itself is “less risky,” since the data is not as well-structured.) As news publishers try to safeguard their contents from AI companies, the Internet Archive is also getting caught in the crosshairs. The Financial Times, for example, blocks any bot that tries to scrape its paywalled content, including bots from OpenAI, Anthropic, Perplexity, and the Internet Archive. The majority of FT stories are paywalled, according to director of global public policy and platform strategy Matt Rogerson . As a result, usually only unpaywalled FT sto\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"IBM tripling entry-level jobs after finding the limits of AI adoption\",\n    \"url\": \"https://fortune.com/2026/02/13/tech-giant-ibm-tripling-gen-z-entry-level-hiring-according-to-chro-rewriting-jobs-ai-era/\",\n    \"heat\": \"217 points\",\n    \"time\": \"9 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"IBM is tripling the number of Gen Z entry-level jobs after finding the limits of AI adoption | Fortune Home Latest Fortune 500 Finance Tech Leadership Lifestyle Rankings Multimedia Success Careers IBM is tripling the number of Gen Z entry-level jobs after finding the limits of AI adoption By Preston Fore Preston Fore Success Reporter Down Arrow Button Icon By Preston Fore Preston Fore Success Reporter Down Arrow Button Icon February 13, 2026, 11:43 AM ET Add us on Gen Z jobs aren’t dead yet: $240 billion tech giant IBM says it’s rewriting entry-level jobs—and tripling down on its hiring of young talent. Dragos Condrea—Getty Images The job market has been a sore subject for Gen Z . The unemployment rate among young college grads sits at 5.6%, hovering near its highest level in more than a decade outside the pandemic. Meanwhile, prominent executives—from Anthropic’s Dario Amodei to Ford’s Jim Farley —have warned that artificial intelligence will slash corporate entry-level jobs. Recommended Video But some companies are realizing that cutting young workers out of the pipeline isn’t a sustainable long-term strategy: $240 billion tech giant IBM just revealed it’s ramping up hiring of Gen Z. “The companies three to five years from now that are going to be the most successful are those companies that doubled down on entry-level hiring in this environment,” Nickle LaMoreaux , IBM’s chief human resources officer, said this week. “We are tripling our entry-level hiring, and yes, that is for software developers and all these jobs we’re being told AI can do.” While she admitted that many of the responsibilities that previously defined entry-level jobs can now be automated, IBM has since rewritten its roles across sectors to account for AI fluency. For example, software engineers will spend less time on routine coding—and more on interacting with customers, and HR staffers will work more on intervening with chatbots, rather than having to answer every question. The shift, LaMoreaux said, builds more durable skills for workers while creating greater long-term value for the company. With job market conditions likely to stay tight for young candidates in 2026, applicants who show initiative and comfort with AI may be the ones who break through at companies like IBM. According to LinkedIn , AI literacy is now the fastest-growing skill in the U.S. Cutting entry-level talent could backfire in the long term, according to IBM’s HR head As AI increases pressure on companies to be leaner and more productive, early-career hiring has often looked like the simplest place to cut. A report from Korn Ferry found that 37% of organizations plan to replace early career roles with AI. But while that strategy might be helpful with short-term financials, LaMoreaux argued, it could cause havoc in the future. Reducing junior headcount risks creating an eventual shortage of mid-level managers. Attempting to poach talent from competitors is likely to be costlier, and outside hires ten\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"source\": \"Hacker News\",\n    \"title\": \"Show HN: Off Grid – Run AI text, image gen, vision offline on your phone\",\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/alichherawalla/off-grid-mobile\",\n    \"heat\": \"24 points\",\n    \"time\": \"2 hours ago\",\n    \"content\": \"GitHub - alichherawalla/off-grid-mobile: The Swiss Army Knife of Offline AI.

This represents a first-of-its-kind case study of misaligned AI behavior in the wild, and raises serious concerns about currently deployed AI agents executing blackmail threats. Start here if you’re new to the story: An AI Agent Published a Hit Piece on Me It’s been an extremely weird past few days, and I have more thoughts on what happened. Let’s start with the news coverage. I’ve talked to several reporters, and quite a few news outlets have covered the story. Ars Technica wasn’t one of the ones that reached out to me, but I especially thought this piece from them was interesting (since taken down – here’s the archive link ). They had some nice quotes from my blog post explaining what was going on. The problem is that these quotes were not written by me, never existed, and appear to be AI hallucinations themselves . This blog you’re on right now is set up to block AI agents from scraping it (I actually spent some time yesterday trying to disable that but couldn’t figure out how). My guess is that the authors asked ChatGPT or similar to either go grab quotes or write the article wholesale. When it couldn’t access the page it generated these plausible quotes instead, and no fact check was performed. I won’t name the authors here. Ars, please issue a correction and an explanation of what happened. “AI agents can research individuals, generate personalized narratives, and publish them online at scale,” Shambaugh wrote. “Even if the content is inaccurate or exaggerated, it can become part of a persistent public record.” – Ars Technica, misquoting me in “ After a routine code rejection, an AI agent published a hit piece on someone by name “ Journalistic integrity aside, I don’t know how I can give a better example of what’s at stake here. Yesterday I wondered what another agent searching the internet would think about this. Now we already have an example of what by all accounts appears to be another AI reinterpreting this story and hallucinating false information about me. And that interpretation has already been published in a major news outlet, as part of the persistent public record. MJ Rathbun is still active on github, and no one has reached out yet to claim ownership. There has been extensive discussion about whether the AI agent really wrote the hit piece on its own, or if a human prompted it to do so. I think the actual text being autonomously generated and uploaded by an AI is self-evident, so let’s look at the two possibilities. 1) A human prompted MJ Rathbun to write the hit piece, or told it in its soul document that it should retaliate if someone crosses it. This is entirely possible.

Running LLMs in VMs isolates them from the host system, mitigating numerous security risks such as destructive operations or unauthorized file access (i.e. private keys, secrets, credentials for communication tools). This is particularly important when granting LLM agents broad permissions, like auto-approving tool use (“yolo mode”). It’s also useful to keep sessions running for extended periods of time, and to interact with agents from the phone / on the go.

Another noteworthy related post is Claude Code On-The-Go (granda.org) which concisely outlines a neat remote Claude Code setup, where I drew some inspiration from. Contents Why Libvirt and Virsh? Libvirt is the standard virtualization API for Linux, providing a unified interface to manage VMs across different hypervisors (KVM, QEMU, Xen, etc.). The virsh command-line tool is the primary way to interact with libvirt. Libvirt is ideal for production-grade VM isolation of LLM agents on Linux servers, and the combination of Ubuntu cloud images and cloud-init makes VM provisioning fast, pleasant, and scriptable. Libvirt vs Lima: When to use which? Both libvirt/virsh and Lima are excellent tools for VM-based isolation, with some notable differences: Aspect Libvirt/Virsh Lima Best for Linux servers macOS, Linux desktop Production use Common, battle-tested Primarily for development Hypervisor support KVM/QEMU, Xen, LXC, etc. Apple’s Virtualization.framework, QEMU Resource overhead Lower Slightly higher Setup complexity Simple ( apt install ) Simple ( brew install lima ) Host directory sharing Manual ( 9p , virtiofs ) Built-in, YAML config, home by default (dangerous) Port forwarding Manual iptables/NAT config Built-in, YAML config GUI tools virt-manager available None (CLI only) Snapshots Native, robust Not working on macOS For server-based LLM agent isolation, libvirt is generally the better choice due to its maturity, lower overhead, and robust management features. Installation Install the required packages on your Ubuntu/Debian server: sudo apt update sudo apt install -y qemu-kvm libvirt-daemon-system virtinst Enable and start the libvirt daemon: sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd Verify the installation: sudo virsh version To avoid needing sudo , you could add your user to the libvirt group (requires re-login): sudo usermod -aG libvirt $USER Download a Cloud Image We’ll use Ubuntu, which provides pre-built cloud images .

Read the preprint (opens in a new window) Loading… Share We’ve published a new preprint showing that a type of particle interaction many physicists expected would not occur can in fact arise under specific conditions. The work focuses on gluons, the particles that carry the strong nuclear force. The preprint ⁠ (opens in a new window) is available on arXiv and is being submitted for publication. In the meantime, we welcome feedback from the community. The preprint, titled “ Single-minus gluon tree amplitudes are nonzero ,” is authored by Alfredo Guevara (Institute for Advanced Study), Alex Lupsasca (Vanderbilt University and OpenAI), David Skinner (University of Cambridge), and Andrew Strominger (Harvard University), and Kevin Weil (OpenAI) on behalf of OpenAI. The preprint studies a central concept in particle physics called a scattering amplitude. A scattering amplitude is the quantity physicists use to compute the probability that particles interact in a particular way. For gluons, the particles that carry the strong nuclear force, many amplitudes take unexpectedly simple forms “at tree level” (meaning calculations that keep only the simplest diagrams with no quantum loops). These simplifications have repeatedly revealed deeper structure in quantum field theory, the framework that provides a description of physics that unifies special relativity with quantum mechanics. One case, however, has generally been treated as absent (having zero amplitude). When one gluon has negative helicity (meaning one of the two possible spin orientations a massless particle can have) and the remaining n − 1 n-1 n − 1 gluons have positive helicity, standard textbook arguments suggest that the corresponding tree-level amplitude must be zero. As a result, this configuration has largely been set aside. The preprint shows that this conclusion is too strong. The standard argument assumes generic particle momenta, meaning the directions and energies are not in any special alignment. We identify a specific and precisely define
